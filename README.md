# RPA Project Portfolio

This repository showcases my collection of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) projects developed using UiPath (Enterprise Edition). Each project is provided as an individual ZIP file for easy download and review.

## What's Inside

Every ZIP file in this repository contains a complete UiPath project built with the Robotic Enterprise Framework (REFramework). These projects demonstrate my ability to design modular, scalable, and production-ready automation solutions.

## Key Features

- All projects use REFramework
- Includes robust exception handling and retry mechanisms
- Covers a variety of real-world automation use cases
- Config-driven and modular workflow structure
- Each ZIP file includes all required workflows, assets, and configuration files

## How to Use

2. Extract the contents to your local machine.
3. Open the project using UiPath Studio.
4. Review, run, or customize the workflow as needed.
